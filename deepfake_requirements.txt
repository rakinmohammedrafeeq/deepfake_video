# Deepfake Video Detection - Python Dependencies
# Install with: pip install -r deepfake_requirements.txt

# Core dependencies
opencv-python>=4.5.0        # Computer vision and video processing
mediapipe>=0.10.0           # Google's ML solutions for face mesh detection
numpy>=1.19.0               # Numerical computing for calculations

# The system uses these features:
# - MediaPipe Face Mesh (478 landmarks including iris)
# - OpenCV for video capture and display
# - NumPy for mathematical operations (EAR, MAR, blur detection, etc.)

# All detection is rule-based and CPU-only, no GPU required
# No additional ML models need to be downloaded

# Python version requirement: 3.8+
